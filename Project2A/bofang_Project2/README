#Introduction of MPIPageRank

There are four files in the project 2a folder:
	1, MPIPageRank.java
		This is the source code of this project.
	2, MPIPageRank.class
		This is the class file from the successful compiling of MPIPageRank.java
	3, pagerank.input.1000.0
		This is the file containing 1000 URLs that will be used to calculate the pagerank.
	4, output.txt
		This is the output file that containing the sorted result of MPIPageRank for the pagerank.input.1000.0
		(When excuting, it will appear the top 10 pagerank in the commandline. but store all the rank in this txt file.)


#MPIPageRank.java
	There are sixe methods in this class
	1, parseArgs (mostly same as sequentialpagerank.java, added "delta" parameter)
	2, loadInput (exactely same as sequentialpagerank.java)
	3, printValues (mostly same as sequentialpagerank.java)
	4, getstartpoint (associate with mpi method, calculate each start index for each process)
	5, mpi (main idea is the similar with sequentialpagerank.java, but allocate URLs to each processes by MPI. Added delta judgment at the end of the iteration loop)
	6, main (invoke mpi)
